/** NOTES:
 * - Focus on similar topics instead of doing multiple different topics. Use the one foot in one foot out method to help understand new things based
 *  on what you already know (80/20 rule - 80% of interviews will most likely cover 20% material). If you don't understand something start with
 *  learning the most basic code about the topic
 * - Focus on the right things: Strings & Arrays, Trees and Graphs, and Dynamic Programming and Backtracking
 * - Plan what you want to study because studying for 30-45 mins and reviewing what you have learned before will help with memory retention!! It's
 *  more efficient than studying for 8 hrs and eventually forgetting everything. The plan can be built off of easy problems you just learned about
 *  a topic
 * - Understand learning DS and Algos: start with the basics > find patterns (removing node or DFS) > combine patterns to solve interview problems
 * Interview Prep Roadblock Fixes
 * - study everything -> study right things
 * - rely on natural skill -> learn to (whiteboard) interview
 * - study a lot -> study consistently

// review how to do aceleration problem with BFS
// do you have to think of all the edge cases before you start coding or is it okay to miss things and find cases as you create a solution??
// how can you tell runtimes with multiplication in trees and graphs ???
